                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello I'm Camelia, a frontend developer with a deep passion for creating beautiful, 
                        accessible, and performant web experiences. My journey into tech began with curiosity 
                        and has evolved into a genuine love for problem-solving and building things that make 
                        a difference in people's lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that great software is not just about writing code—it's about understanding 
                        users, empathizing with their needs, and crafting solutions that are both elegant and 
                        practical. Every line of code is an opportunity to make someone's day a little better, 
                        and that drives me to continuously improve my craft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond coding, I'm an advocate for open-source software and knowledge sharing. I believe 
                        the best way to grow is to learn in public, share what you know, and help others along 
                        their journey. The developer community has given me so much, and I'm committed to giving back.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Areas Where I'm Building Confidence</h2>
                    <p>
                        Growth requires honesty about our challenges. Here are areas where I'm actively 
                        working to build my confidence:
                    </p>
                    

                    <h3>System Design & Scalability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Designing systems that scale efficiently and handle large amounts of data is 
                        something I find challenging. I'm eager to learn more about performance optimization, 
                        caching strategies, and building resilient systems.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Testing Strategies</h3>
                    <p>
                        I understand the importance of testing, but I sometimes struggle with knowing 
                        what to test, how much to test, and which testing approaches are most effective 
                        for different scenarios. I want to develop confidence in writing comprehensive 
                        test suites.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Speaking Up in Technical Discussions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes I hesitate to share my ideas in group settings, worried they might not 
                        be valuable. I'm working on building the confidence to contribute more actively 
                        and trust that my perspective has merit.
                    </p>

                            <strong>My Commitment:</strong> I'm approaching these challenges not as weaknesses, 
                            but as opportunities for growth. Every expert was once a beginner, and I'm excited 
                            to embrace the discomfort of learning something new.

                            Dear Future Camelia,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're reading this, you've come a long way. Remember when you felt uncertain 
                            about whether you belonged in tech? Look at you now—you've pushed through the 
                            challenges, learned from failures, and celebrated the victories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Don't forget the excitement you felt when you first made a webpage come to life, 
                            or the satisfaction of solving a problem that seemed impossible. Hold onto that 
                            curiosity and wonder. Technology will change, frameworks will evolve, but your 
                            passion for creating and learning should remain constant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Be kind to yourself when things get difficult. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You've got this.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
                    
                    <h3>What Motivates Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm motivated by impact. Knowing that something I built helps someone be more 
                        productive, brings them joy, or solves a real problem gives me immense satisfaction. 
                        I also find motivation in the developer community—seeing others share their knowledge 
                        freely inspires me to do the same.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Learning Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>
                        I believe in learning by doing. Theory is important, but nothing beats the experience 
                        of building something, breaking it, and fixing it. I also think it's crucial to teach 
                        what you learn—explaining concepts to others solidifies your own understanding and 
                        helps you identify gaps in your knowledge.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Work-Life Balance</h3>
                    <p>
                        While I'm passionate about coding, I also recognize the importance of stepping away 
                        from the screen. Photography helps me see the world differently, hiking clears my mind, 
                        and spending time with friends and family keeps me grounded. A well-rounded life makes 
                        me a better developer.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                    <p>
                        Five years from now, I see myself as a senior developer who not only writes great code 
                        but also mentors others and contributes to shaping the culture of the teams I work with. 
                        I want to be someone who makes others feel welcome in tech, especially those who might 
                        feel like they don't belong.
